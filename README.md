### What I learned

In this project, I have learnt to use JavaScript and jQuery to make API calls. I have also learnt to parse the JSON response and populate various fields on the screen with the received response.

### Useful resources

- [Here are the most popular ways to make an HTTP request in JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/here-is-the-most-popular-ways-to-make-an-http-request-in-javascript-954ce8c95aaa/) - This helped me in making the HTTP request efficiently. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
